# Windy Grid World 

This is a single solution to Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning Exercises for on-policy TD learning (SARSA).

Problem: 
- Minimise steps required to reach terminal state in a grid world with windy columns
- A windy column has a value that moves the agent up a grid square by a certain value
- For Example: if state (4,5) is on a windy column of 2, then an agent on this state will move to (2,5)

RL Algorithm:
- Policy: fixed e-greedy
- SARSA: On-policy Tabluar TD
